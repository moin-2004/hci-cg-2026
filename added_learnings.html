  <h2>Self Study</h2>
  <p>
    Effective interface design requires time and careful consideration, but
    even small, user-focused decisions—such as involving real users early in
    the process—can help avoid major design problems. The automatic syringe
    case illustrates how a numeric keypad interface caused a dangerous
    tenfold dosage error, an issue that was only identified after consulting
    hospital staff.
  </p>
  <article>
    <h3>Analyzing the Syringe Interface Using Different Models</h3>
    <p>
      The sections below describe how Norman’s Model, GOMS, and KLM each
      evaluate the syringe interface redesign, in which a numeric keypad was
      replaced with increment and decrement buttons.
    </p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h4>Norman’s Cycle of Action</h4>
    <p>
      Norman’s model reveals a significant gulf of execution in the original
      keypad-based design. The user’s goal of setting a precise dose was poorly
      supported, as a single extra key press could lead to a lethal dosage.
      The redesigned button interface narrows this gulf by aligning user
      intentions with safer, more controlled actions.
    </p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h4>GOMS Model</h4>
    <p>
      From a GOMS perspective, entering a dose is decomposed into goals,
      methods, and operators. While the keypad allows quicker input, it offers
      little assistance for spotting or correcting errors. The button-based
      approach is slower, but it requires users to confirm each change,
      increasing overall task safety.
    </p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h4>Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)</h4>
    <p>
      KLM is used to predict execution time for experienced users. It would
      likely indicate that keypad entry is faster due to fewer keystrokes,
      whereas repeated button presses take more time. However, this comparison
      also highlights that efficiency alone is insufficient when evaluating
      safety-critical systems such as medical devices.
    </p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h4>The Importance of Iteration</h4>
    <p>
      Because users and usage contexts are complex, interface design rarely
      succeeds on the first attempt. Developing early prototypes and engaging
      users throughout the design process helps uncover serious issues before
      they become permanently built into the system.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>Norman’s Model of Interaction</h3>
    <p>
      Donald Norman is a leading figure in Human–Computer Interaction, widely
      recognized for advocating user-centered design, usability, and cognitive
      engineering. His interaction model is influential because it closely
      reflects how users naturally think about and interact with computer
      systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Norman’s model, interaction begins with the formation of a goal and a
      plan to achieve it. The user then carries out actions through the
      interface. Afterward, the user observes the system’s response and
      evaluates whether the result matches the original goal, determining the
      next steps.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h4>The Seven Stages of Action</h4>
    <p>
      Norman divides interaction into two primary phases: execution and
      evaluation. Together, these phases consist of seven stages:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Defining the goal</li>
      <li>Forming the intention</li>
      <li>Specifying the action sequence</li>
      <li>Executing the action</li>
      <li>Perceiving the system state</li>
      <li>Interpreting the system state</li>
      <li>Evaluating the outcome against the goal</li>
    </ol>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h4>Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation</h4>
    <p>
      Norman uses this framework to explain why poorly designed interfaces
      cause user difficulties. The gulf of execution is the gap between a
      user’s goals and the actions the system allows. The gulf of evaluation
      is the gap between the system’s output and how easily the user can
      understand it.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h4>Human Error: Slips and Mistakes</h4>
    <p>
      Human errors can be categorized as slips or mistakes. Slips occur when
      the user understands the system but performs an incorrect action, such
      as pressing the wrong button. Mistakes occur when the user forms an
      incorrect goal due to misunderstanding the system, such as misreading
      the meaning of an icon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slips can often be minimized through improved interface design, such as
      increasing the distance between buttons. Mistakes usually require more
      substantial solutions, including interface redesigns, better training,
      or clearer metaphors.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>GOMS Model</h3>
    <p>
      The GOMS model, introduced by Card, Moran, and Newell, explains task
      performance by breaking interaction into Goals, Operators, Methods, and
      Selection rules. It helps designers analyze both the mental and physical
      components of user tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goals define what the user aims to accomplish. Operators are basic
      actions, such as pressing a key or reading a message. Methods represent
      different ways to achieve a goal, while selection rules determine which
      method is chosen based on context or experience.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h4>Design Focus: Why GOMS Saves Money</h4>
    <p>
      GOMS has been applied in real-world system evaluations. For instance,
      the telecommunications company NYNEX used GOMS to assess a proposed
      computer system and found it would perform more slowly than the existing
      one. As a result, the project was abandoned, saving the company millions
      of dollars.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)</h3>
    <p>
      The Keystroke-Level Model is a more detailed extension of GOMS that
      focuses on predicting execution time for expert users performing routine
      tasks. It is intended for short, clearly defined tasks that typically
      take less than 20 seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      KLM assumes error-free performance and focuses exclusively on the
      execution phase of interaction. It breaks tasks down into low-level
      operators, such as keystrokes, mouse clicks, pointing, hand movements,
      mental preparation, and system response time.
    </p>
    <p>
      By assigning standard time values to each operator and adding them
      together, KLM enables designers to compare interface designs or task
      methods and predict which will be faster—without conducting full user
      studies.

          <h3>HCI Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) combines concepts from
            <strong>Cognitive Psychology</strong>, <strong>Design</strong>, and
            <strong>Computer Science</strong> to understand how humans interact
            with technology.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Humans often perform tasks based on how they were taught or what
              they observed at a young age (e.g., drawing a glass from memory).
            </li>
            <li>
              Habits can be changed, but the fundamental nature of a person
              remains stable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Humans store information in:
              <ul>
                <li>Short-Term Memory (STM)</li>
                <li>Long-Term Memory (LTM)</li>

            <li>
              Cognitive Neural Networks (CNNs) resemble human processing by

              Chunking breaks large information into smaller units (e.g.,
              1234567890 → 123-456-7890).

          <h3>UI vs UX</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>UI (User Interface)</strong> focuses on the visual design of
            a product and how it looks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>UX (User Experience)</strong> focuses on the overall
            experience and how the product feels to use, including usability and
            satisfaction.

          <h3>The Automatic Syringe Case</h3>
          <p>
            The Automatic Syringe case demonstrates how small interface design
            decisions can lead to serious consequences. Numeric keypads caused
            dangerous input errors due to accidental key presses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interfaces rarely work perfectly on the first attempt, making
            iteration essential. Early prototypes should be easy to modify or
            discard, and rapid prototyping techniques such as paper sketches and
            mock-ups help designers test ideas quickly before full development.
